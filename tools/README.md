Mega Man Battle Network 3 Randomizer Tools
============
Here's some tools to use alongside the Randomizer.

NCP Shape Editor
============
This program is used to generate Navi Customizer Program Shapes for the BN3 Randomizer to select from. This was made in GameMaker Studio.

**Controls**
 - _I:_ Import Pattern Code
 - _R:_ Reset Current Pattern
 - _S:_ Save Current Pattern
 - _LMB/RMB:_ Cycle Square Colors

**Instructions**

In the 5x5 Grid, you may change each square in the grid to one of 4 colors.
 - _Gray:_ Hollow/Disabled. Will not show up.
 - _Green:_ Uncompressed-Enabled: Will show up only if uncompressed.
 - _Blue:_ Always Enabled: Will always show up.
 - _Orange:_ Compressed-Enabled: Will show up only if compressed.

Once you have a shape you're happy with, hit **"S"** to output the pattern's code to a file. These can be read by the randomizer.
